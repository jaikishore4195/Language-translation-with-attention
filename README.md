Project Introduction:
Built a language translation from scratch with attention mechanism for German to English.

Model use case in industry:
The model apart from being used for translation, we can use the same model with minor tweaks for summarization of text and Question answering on a paragraph.

For decoding used Greedy and Random Search and currently working on Building Beam search. Used BLEU metric for comparison and tracking performance. And the BLEU score was around 25.
